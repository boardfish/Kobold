# Kobold: the keyboard that yaps

Cheesy project I'm working on - a keyboard that makes all the same typing noises as your favourite characters from games like Banjo-Kazooie and Undertale\*. It's my first foray into Android development, so excuse the mess. Thankfully it's only taken an hour or so thus far.

## Installation

Build the APK from Android Studio, erm, somehow. Right now I've just been using the Run function. I'll document this properly once I've gotten to the bottom of it myself, but if you're a seasoned Android dev, I'd welcome you to...

## Contribute!

Right now, there's only one soundpack. But I'd like to add the following features:

- More soundpacks with preset settings, selectable from within the app!
- Downloadable soundpacks with preset settings, selectable from within the app! I'll have to develop a service to handle this. Might just fling zip files onto an Apache server if that works, and allow the app to download them somehow.
- Tweakable:
  - pitch variation
  - base pitch
  - speed variation
  - base speed
  - (This could be tough) Adjusting the chance for each sound to appear

Sound effects used are property of Rare Ltd. and will be taken down if requested.

\*Only Kazooie is available at the minute.
