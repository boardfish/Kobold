# Kobold: the keyboard that yaps

A keyboard that makes all the same typing noises as Kazooie from Banjo-Kazooie. Served as a small first foray into Android development.

## Installation

Use the Run function in Android Studio, then open the Kobold app and enable the keyboard in Settings.

## Future work that could've been

I'd have liked to have added the following features:

- More soundpacks with preset settings, selectable from within the app
- Downloadable soundpacks with preset settings, selectable from within the app
- Tweakable:
  - pitch variation
  - base pitch
  - speed variation
  - base speed
  - Adjusting the chance for each sound to appear

Sound effects used are property of Rare Ltd. and will be taken down if requested.
